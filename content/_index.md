Hi, I'm a student from Germany. This site gives me space to write and share
whatever I want to on the Internet, so do I.
I spend my freetime mostly with {{<highlight>}}reading Sci-Fi books{{</highlight>}}, {{<highlight>}}coding{{</highlight>}} and {{<highlight>}}observing the night sky{{</highlight>}}.

### Fav books📖

- Otherland Series by Tad Williams
- Trisolaris Trilogy by Cixin Lui
- The Lord of The Rings by J.R.R. Tolkin

### Why I coded this page
At first glance it seems fairly unnecessary to code and maintain an own website,
but having something that belongs truly to you in the mess of today's Social Media, a place only for
yourself that you can costumize and design to your needs, feels like a small oasis you can always escape to.
