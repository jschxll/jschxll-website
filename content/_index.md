## whoami
I'm Jan, a student from Germany and this is my personal page. I'll share pictures, projects and other stuff that comes me in mind.{{<line-break>}}
Recently, experimente with servers and machine learning algorithms (it ends mostly in headache) and create useless gadgets (see: [smart home plasma ball]({{< ref "smarthome-plasmaball-automation.md">}})), but I'm also interested in science, especially in astronomy.{{<line-break>}} That's why, I mostly read Sci-Fi romans:-D

So, why did he create this page, you think? - Here a few reasons:

-> I like the idea behind the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) {{<line-break>}}
-> Learning web-dev technologies along this page {{<line-break>}}
-> Improving my English writing skills (I'm from Germany, btw)
